# Clarity Engine

**Clarity Engine** is a personal and psychological system designed to help you **distinguish between Trash and Clutter**, manage your belongings, and reduce mental load. This project lays the foundation for an **AI-assisted decision system** that evaluates items for practical, emotional, and energetic alignment.

---

## 🧠 Concept Overview

### Trash

- **Definition:** Anything with zero remaining value or purpose.
- **Effect:** Drains because it is dead weight.
- **Action:** Remove immediately — it holds no functional or emotional benefit.

### Clutter

- **Definition:** Items we are not actively using but continue to keep because of emotional attachment, ego, nostalgia, memories of past relationships, or the belief that we might need them someday — even if they serve no current purpose.
- **Additional:** Clutter also includes items that have value but are **not in the right place, quantity, or timing**.
- **Effect:** Drains because it is potential energy with no direction.
- **Action:** Reassign, reduce, or release depending on alignment.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Clarity Engine helps answer:

1. **Is this item trash or clutter?**
2. **What should I do with it today?**

This project is structured to later incorporate AI for:

- Emotional and functional evaluation of items
- Categorization
- Personalized action recommendations

---

## ⚡ Features (Planned)

- Core **Trash vs Clutter definitions** module
- Interactive **item classification system**
- **Decision tree** to guide reassign/reduce/release actions
- **AI-ready architecture** for scoring and predictive recommendations
- Future **visualizations** of clutter and energy flow

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React (Create React App)**
- **CSS Modules / Styled Components** (for theming)
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- Optional: **AI scoring module** (planned)
